## 📊 Project Status: Beta (Functional Core Ready)
The Sentinel project core is now **secure and stable**. We have moved from "PoC" to "Alpha".

## ✅ Completed Items (What we achieved today)
1.  **Fixed Critical Vulnerability ("Lying Ledger"):**
    *   *Action:* Implemented Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) with `UniqueConstraint` on `(org_id, prev_hash)`.
    *   *Result:* `tests/stress_test.py` now passes with 200 concurrent requests. `tests/verify_chain.py` confirms **"Chain is VALID"**.
2.  **Built Client SDK:**
    *   *Action:* Created `sentinel-sdk` Python package in `sdk/`.
    *   *Result:* Developers can now use `client.log()` instead of raw HTTP calls.
3.  **Built Infrastructure Agent:**
    *   *Action:* Created `agent/sentinel-wrapper.sh` to intercept Docker commands.
    *   *Result:* Solves the "Who deleted the volume?" problem.

## 🚧 Remaining Blockers (To be Production Ready)
1.  **Fake Authentication:**
    *   *Status:* **PENDING**.
    *   *Current State:* API accepts any token.
    *   *Next Step:* Implement real OIDC (Azure AD) or simple API Key validation.
2.  **Deployment Package:**
    *   *Status:* **PENDING**.
    *   *Current State:* Runs on local SQLite.
    *   *Next Step:* Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for PostgreSQL production setup.

## 💡 Strategic Decisions Log
*   **Database Switch:** We stuck with SQLite + OCC for the Alpha. This proves the *logic* works without needing complex Redis queues yet.
*   **Agent Strategy:** We implemented the "Shell Alias" method for the agent. It is lightweight and effective for trusted teams, though less secure than kernel probes (future roadmap).
